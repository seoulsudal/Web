	When alice follows the white Rabbit down a rabbit hole, she finds herself in a land where she can change her size. She meets a Duchess with a pig for a baby, a Cook that throws spoons, a wise but mad Cheshir cat, the March hare, Mad Hatter and aDormouse. A Caterpillar shows her how to adjust her height by eating from the right and left sides of a mushroom. With that knowledge Alice is able to enter a beautiful garden to play croquet with the Queen of Hearts. This game of croquet is played with flamingos (mallets), balls (curled-ip hedgehogs) and an army of bent-over cards (arches). As the living croquet game continually changes, the Queen has most of her huests arrested, but introduces Alice to a Gryphon and Mock Turtle
	By the end, almost everyone she meets ends up in a courtroom where the King of Hearts wants a verict before the evidence, jurors pay attention to all the wrong information, witnesses are thereatened with punishment and Alice grows tall enough not to be intimidated by a pack of cards, which is what the court and soldiers are. Suddenly Alice wakes up and realizes that ger entire adventure was and amazing dream.</p>
